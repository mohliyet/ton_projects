# Types of Blockchain

Blockchains can be classified based on the level of access allowed to the network, the layer structure, the consensus mechanism used, permissions required to participate in the network, token economy, and functionality.

## Classification Based on Access Level

### Public Blockchains
These are open to anyone and everyone can participate as anonymous nodes. They can execute transactions and take part in the consensus process. Examples include `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`, and `Litecoin`. These blockchains are fully decentralized.

### Private Blockchains
These are not open to everyone and only allow known entities to participate in the network. They are often used within single organizations or by consortiums. Examples include `Hyperledger` and `R3 Corda`. These blockchains can be `centralized` or `decentralized`, depending on the setup.

### Consortium Blockchains
These are `semi-decentralized` and allow only a certain number of nodes to execute a consensus protocol. They are often used in the `banking sector`. An example is `Quorum`, which is used by J.P. Morgan.

## Classification Based on Layer Structure

### Layer 1 Blockchains
These are the foundational blockchain protocols, such as `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum` and `TON`. They provide the base layer where the native transactional currency resides, and where blocks of transactions are added. Layer 1 solutions are improvements to the blockchain protocol itself that increase the network's capacity.

### Layer 2 Blockchains
These are protocols built on top of Layer 1 blockchains. They aim to improve the scalability and efficiency of Layer 1 blockchains by taking some of the computational load off the main chain. Examples include `Lightning Network` for Bitcoin and `Plasma` for Ethereum.

## Classification Based on Consensus Mechanism

### Proof of Work (PoW)
This is used by Bitcoin and involves miners solving complex mathematical problems to add a new block to the blockchain.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
This is used by Ethereum (in its upcoming Ethereum 2.0 version) and involves validators being chosen to create a new block based on their stake, or the amount of crypto they hold and are willing to 'stake' for the chance to add a block.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
This is a more democratic version where stakeholders vote on who should be the validators. EOS uses this consensus mechanism.

### Proof of Authority (PoA)
This is used by some private and consortium blockchains where only authorized nodes are allowed to validate transactions.

## Classification Based on Permissions

### Permissionless Blockchains
These are open to anyone, and anyone can participate in the consensus process, validate transactions, or create new blocks. Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of permissionless blockchains.

### Permissioned Blockchains
These are not open to everyone, and only a select group of people have the rights to participate in the consensus process. Private and consortium blockchains are examples of permissioned blockchains.

## Classification Based on Token Economy

### Blockchains with a Native Token
These blockchains have a native token, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which is used for transaction fees and can be used within the network for various purposes.

### Blockchains without a Native Token
These blockchains do not have a native token and instead rely on a third-party token or other means for transaction fees and network operations.

## Classification Based on Functionality

### General-Purpose Blockchains
These blockchains, like Ethereum, can run any type of smart contract and are designed to be versatile and adaptable to a wide range of applications.

### Specific-Purpose Blockchains
These blockchains, like Namecoin, are designed for a specific purpose or application, such as domain name registration.
