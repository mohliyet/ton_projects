## Binance Account Suspension Due to Self-Trading

My Binance account has been suspended due to a violation of the P2P transaction policy. The reason provided for this suspension is abnormal wash-trading or self-trading behavior.

### Suspension Details

- **Suspension**: My account is currently suspended, meaning I am unable to perform any transactions until the suspension is lifted.
- **Reason for Suspension**: The suspension has been enacted due to abnormal wash-trading or self-trading behavior. Wash-trading refers to the practice of selling and buying the same financial instrument to manipulate the market. Self-trading involves a trader buying and selling the same instrument for accounts they control. Both practices are considered market manipulation and are prohibited on most trading platforms, including Binance.
- **Supporting Document File**: This could refer to any evidence or documentation Binance has to support their claim of policy violation. Alternatively, they might be asking me to provide documentation or evidence to refute their claim.

I am currently seeking to have the suspension lifted and am in the process of contacting Binance's customer support directly. I will provide them with any information or documentation that could help clarify the situation.

## Understanding Wash Trading

Wash trading is a type of market manipulation where an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. This is done to make it appear as though the financial instrument has more trading volume than it actually does.

### How Does Wash Trading Work?

In a wash trade, an investor (or a group of investors working together) will both buy and sell the same financial instrument at the same price. Because the same entity is both the buyer and the seller, there is no net change in ownership of the instrument. However, to outside observers, it appears as though a transaction has taken place.

### Definition of Wash Trading

Wash trading involves an investor (or a group of investors) buying and selling the same financial instrument at the same price, often simultaneously. The key characteristic of a wash trade is that the same entity is both the buyer and the seller, resulting in no net change in ownership of the instrument. Despite this, to outside observers, it appears as though a legitimate transaction has taken place.

### Why is Wash Trading Prohibited?

Wash trading is considered deceptive and is illegal in many markets, including most stock exchanges and commodities markets. The artificial trading volume created by wash trading can mislead other investors into believing there is more demand for a financial instrument than there actually is. This can influence their trading decisions, leading to an inaccurate market price.

In the context of cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, wash trading can be used to manipulate the perceived value of a cryptocurrency, leading to potential price volatility. This is why such practices are against the policies of many exchanges.

Dear Binance Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you regarding a recent issue with my account.

My account has been suspended due to what has been described as "abnormal wash-trading or self-trading behavior". However, I believe there may have been a misunderstanding. My account activity is under the 20 trades limit set by the P2P requirements, and I am currently unable to post ads.

I am confident that my trading behavior has been in compliance with Binance's policies, and I suspect that this suspension may be a mistake. I kindly request that you review the activity on my account and consider lifting the suspension.

I understand that certain information is required for the restriction removal process. However, I am finding it difficult to access some of the requested information. I would appreciate it if you could provide some guidance or alternative solutions to this issue.

I am more than willing to cooperate and provide any additional information or documentation that I can access and that may assist in resolving this issue. I appreciate your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
