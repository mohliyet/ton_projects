# Introduction to Blockchain and Solidity

## Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and development was crowdfunded in 2014.

- **Founder:** Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer who is best known as one of the co-founders of Ethereum.

- **Difference from Bitcoin:** While Bitcoin (BTC) is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. In the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network.

## Nick Szabo

Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called "bit gold" in 1998, although it was never implemented. It's been noted that bit gold has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third-party intermediary.

- **Comparison to Traditional Contracts:** You can think of smart contracts as traditional written contracts that are enforced by a blockchain network instead of a legal system. They automatically execute contractual obligations, reducing the risk of error and the need for trust.

- **Role in Ethereum:** Smart contracts are a key feature of Ethereum. They enable the development of complex dApps, as they can handle logic, calculations, and data manipulation in response to specific triggers.

## Ethereum vs Bitcoin

The main differentiator between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) is their purpose and capability. Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, designed to work as a medium of exchange, while Ethereum is a platform that allows for the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications, powered by its own currency, Ether.

## Bitcoin's Turing Incompleteness

The term "Turing complete" refers to a system that can simulate a Turing machine, which in theory is capable of solving any computation problem given enough resources and time. A Turing complete language can perform loops, conditional branching, and store data.

Bitcoin's scripting language, used for creating transactions, is intentionally not Turing complete. This means it lacks certain capabilities, such as loops, that are found in most programming languages. 

There are several reasons for this design choice:

- **Security:** Loops could potentially create vulnerabilities, such as infinite loops, that could be exploited by malicious actors to disrupt the Bitcoin network.

- **Predictability:** Without loops or complex control structures, the outcome and resource requirements of a Bitcoin script can be determined in advance, which is important for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.

- **Simplicity:** The primary purpose of Bitcoin's scripting language is to process transactions, which requires only simple scripts. A more complex, Turing complete language would not necessarily provide additional benefits, but it would make the system more complex and potentially more prone to errors and vulnerabilities.

## Oracle Problem in Blockchain

The oracle problem in blockchain refers to the challenge of bringing real-world information onto the blockchain so that smart contracts can use this data. 

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute actions based on predefined rules and conditions. However, these smart contracts live on the blockchain and are isolated from the outside world. They cannot access real-world data or events on their own.

Oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information. They serve as bridges between blockchains and the outside world. Oracles can provide various types of data, such as price information, the outcome of an event, or other types of real-world data.

The oracle problem arises due to the need to trust these oracles. The data provided by the oracle can affect the execution of a smart contract, so it's crucial that this data is accurate and reliable. However, if the oracle is compromised or provides false information, it can lead to incorrect execution of the smart contract, which can be particularly problematic in financial or legally binding contracts.

Various solutions have been proposed to mitigate the oracle problem, including decentralized oracles, multiple oracles, and prediction markets. However, the oracle problem remains one of the significant challenges in the wider adoption of blockchain technology.
