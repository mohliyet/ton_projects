## Framework for Comparing Costs and Trade-offs of Decentralization

When comparing centralized and decentralized systems, it's important to consider the costs and trade-offs associated with each. 

- **Centralization**: Centralized systems are controlled by a single entity or authority. While this can lead to efficiency and simplicity, it also comes with its own set of costs:
    - **Cost of Capture**: Centralized systems are more susceptible to being controlled or influenced by a single party, which can lead to decisions that favor the controlling party rather than the system as a whole.
    - **Rents**: The controlling entity in a centralized system can extract rents, or excessive profits, due to their control over the system.
    - **Single Point of Failure**: Centralized systems have a single point of failure. If the central authority fails, the entire system can collapse.

- **Decentralization**: Decentralized systems distribute control among many entities or nodes. While this can lead to increased resilience and fairness, it also has its own costs:
    - **Cost of Coordination**: In a decentralized system, coordinating between the many entities or nodes can be challenging and resource-intensive.
    - **Governance**: Deciding how a decentralized system should be run can be difficult due to the lack of a central authority. This can lead to disagreements and conflicts.
    - **Security**: Decentralized systems can be more vulnerable to attacks, as there are many points of entry for potential attackers.
    - **Scalability**: As the number of nodes in a decentralized system increases, it can become more difficult to process transactions quickly and efficiently.

Understanding these costs and trade-offs can help when deciding between implementing a centralized or decentralized system.
