## Bitcoin Technical Features Summary

### Cryptographic and Timestamped Logs
- Utilizes cryptographic hash functions for security.
- Employs timestamped append-only logs (blocks) for data integrity.
- Uses block headers and Merkle trees for efficient data verification.
- Applies asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures for transaction validation.
- Bitcoin addresses are used for transaction destinations.

### Decentralized Network Consensus
- Achieves consensus through the Proof-of-Work mechanism.
- Bitcoin serves as the native currency within the network.
- The network is decentralized, with no central authority.

### Transaction Script and UTXO
- Transactions are composed of inputs and outputs.
- The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set tracks spendable Bitcoins.
- A scripting language is used to specify transaction conditions.
