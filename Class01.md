## History of Money
The evolution of money has been a complex process shaped by societal needs and scarcity of resources. Initially, non-metal forms like salt bars in Ethiopia, cowrie shells in Nigeria, tally sticks in England, and Rai stones in Yap served as money due to their societal value and scarcity.

The concept of money then transitioned to metal forms, with examples like bronze Aes Rude in Rome, copper plates in Sweden, and bronze spades in China. This was followed by the introduction of minted money, such as bronze Yuan in China, silver Dekadrachm in Greece, and gold Aureus in Rome.

The invention of paper led to the creation of paper money, including the Jiaozi promissory note in China, pound note in England, and Continental note in the US. Eventually, private bank notes emerged in countries like Australia, the US, Canada, and England, with small goldsmiths becoming the first dominant bankers in London.
<!-- 
A question that arises from this history is whether money originated from the practice of barter or from the concept of ledgers and credit.

A ledger is basically a way to record economic activity or social relationships or financial relationships. -->

## Ledgers
Ledgers serve as the primary records of accounts, documenting various economic activities and financial relationships, such as debt. They are crucial tools in accounting and finance, providing a structured and chronological record of transactions.

There are several types of ledgers. Transaction ledgers record individual transactions, while balance ledgers maintain the overall balance of an account. General ledgers contain all the financial information of a business, while sub-ledgers provide detailed information about a specific aspect of the business. Single-entry ledgers record transactions as either an incoming or outgoing amount, while double-entry ledgers record transactions twice, as both a debit and a credit.

Good ledgers possess certain characteristics. They are immutable and consistent, ensuring that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered. They are timestamped, providing a chronological record of transactions. They clearly indicate ownership of assets and are accurate, reducing the possibility of errors. They provide a description of each transaction, making it easy to understand the nature of each entry. Lastly, they are comprehensive, capturing all necessary information about each transaction.

Payment systems use ledgers as a method to record and amend changes for money transactions. This includes information related to deposits and negotiable orders such as timestamps, signatures, payee and payer details in the form of account numbers, and the transaction amount.

Historically, ledgers have played a role in early forms of money. For instance, tally sticks in England were used as a form of ledger, with notches cut into them to record transactions. Similarly, Rai Stones in Yap served as a form of ledger, with the oral history of each stone serving as a record of transactions.

## Fiat Currency, Central Banking, and Credit Cards

### Fiat Currency
Fiat currency is a type of money that is issued by the government and is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value is derived from the social and economic consensus. It is represented by central bank liabilities and commercial bank deposits and relies upon a system of ledgers integrated into the fractional banking system. Fiat currency is accepted for taxes, and its notes and coins are considered legal tender for all debts, both public and private. It also has a unique tax treatment, which differentiates it from other forms of wealth or assets.

### Central Banking
Central banks play a crucial role in the financial stability of a country. They regulate the nation's money supply, set interest rates, control inflation, print money, and act as a lender of last resort to commercial banks. Central banks are pivotal in the functioning of the economy and the stability of the nation's currency.

### Credit Cards
A credit card is a payment card issued by a financial institution, typically a bank, that allows cardholders to borrow funds with which to pay for goods and services. The borrowed money must be paid back with interest, often including additional charges. Credit cards are a powerful tool for consumers, allowing them to leverage future income to make purchases in the present.

The term "credit card" was first used in Edward Bellamy's science fiction novel "Looking Backward" in 1887. The evolution of credit cards started with charge plates and credit coins in the late 1880s, which were used until the 1960s. Merchant credit cards appeared in the late 1920s and were used until the 2000s.

The First National Bank of Brooklyn introduced the first bank card, "Charge-It," in 1946. The first general merchant card, Diners' Club, was introduced in 1949. American Express introduced the first plastic card in 1959, and Bank of America introduced the first general-purpose credit card in 1966.
#### Credit Card Processing
The technology for processing credit cards has evolved significantly over the years. In the 1950s, slide card imprinters were used to process credit card transactions. By 1979, Visa introduced imprinters, which were a more efficient way of processing transactions. In 2018, payment terminals became the standard method for processing credit card transactions, offering a quick and secure way for merchants to accept card payments.

## Role and Characteristics of Money 

### Role 
Money serves several key roles in the economy:

1. **Medium of Exchange**: It is used in the exchange of goods and services.
2. **Store of Value**: It allows wealth to be stored and used in the future.
3. **Unit of Account**: It provides a standard measure for pricing goods and services.

### Characteristics
For something to function effectively as money, it should have the following characteristics:

1. **Durable**: It should withstand physical wear and tear.
2. **Portable**: It should be easily transportable.
3. **Divisible**: It should be divisible into smaller units.
4. **Uniform / Fungible**: Each unit should be exactly the same as every other unit.
5. **Acceptable**: Everyone should accept it for transactions.

### Design of Money 
When designing a form of money, several factors need to be considered:

1. **Token Vs Account Based**: Token-based money is physical, like coins and banknotes. Account-based money is digital and exists as a record in a database.
2. **Physical vs Digital**: Physical money is tangible, like coins and banknotes. Digital money exists electronically, like cryptocurrencies or digital wallets.
3. **Private Sector vs Central Bank**: Money can be issued by the private sector (like banknotes in the past or cryptocurrencies today) or by a central bank (like modern-day coins and banknotes).
4. **Widely Accessible vs Wholesale**: Some forms of money are widely accessible to the public (like cash or bank deposits), while others are only accessible to certain financial institutions (like central bank reserves).
