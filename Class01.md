## History of Money
The evolution of money has been a complex process shaped by societal needs and scarcity of resources. Initially, non-metal forms like salt bars in Ethiopia, cowrie shells in Nigeria, tally sticks in England, and Rai stones in Yap served as money due to their societal value and scarcity.

The concept of money then transitioned to metal forms, with examples like bronze Aes Rude in Rome, copper plates in Sweden, and bronze spades in China. This was followed by the introduction of minted money, such as bronze Yuan in China, silver Dekadrachm in Greece, and gold Aureus in Rome.

The invention of paper led to the creation of paper money, including the Jiaozi promissory note in China, pound note in England, and Continental note in the US. Eventually, private bank notes emerged in countries like Australia, the US, Canada, and England, with small goldsmiths becoming the first dominant bankers in London.

A question that arises from this history is whether money originated from the practice of barter or from the concept of ledgers and credit.

A ledger is basically a way to record economic activity or social relationships or financial relationships. -->
