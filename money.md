# Money 
## Role of money
Money plays several key roles in our economy and daily life. Firstly, it serves as a `medium of exchange`, facilitating the buying and selling of goods and services. Secondly, it acts as a `store of value`, allowing individuals to save and accumulate wealth. Lastly, it functions as a `unit of account`, providing a standard measure for pricing items and recording transactions.
## Role of Finance
Finance plays a crucial role in moving resources from areas of surplus to areas of need. It is instrumental in allocating resources and capital efficiently in an economy. Furthermore, finance is key in pricing assets based on their risk level and expected rate of return.
## Financial sector issues with blockchain technology 
The financial sector faces several issues with blockchain technology. These include performance, scalability, and efficiency, which are critical for high-speed financial transactions. Privacy and security are also major concerns, given the sensitive nature of financial data. Interoperability is another challenge, as it is necessary for different blockchain systems to communicate with each other. Lastly, governance issues arise due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.
## Financial sector favors
The financial sector tends to favor permissioned blockchains over permissionless ones. Permissioned blockchains have a known set of participants, do not require proof-of-work or mining, have no need for a native currency, and essentially function as distributed database technology. On the other hand, permissionless blockchains involve unknown participants, base their security on incentives, require a native currency, and operate on the principles of crypto-economics.
